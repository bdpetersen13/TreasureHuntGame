## Scenario

Developed a treasure hunt game where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it. For this game, an intelligent agent has been designed to be an NPC representing the pirate. The pirate must navigate the game world, which consists of different pathways and obstacles, to find the treasure. The pirate agent’s goal is to find the treasure before the human player. This is commonly called a pathfinding problem, as the agent you create will need to find a path toward its goal.




## Project Brief

For this project, the gameExperience.py and treasureMaze.py files, which provide the game startup information, were provided. In addition, the code utilizes the reinforcement learning algorithm using Keras and TensorFlow libraries to develop the pathfinding solution I wrote. 
## Answering Larger Questions

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

        Computer Scientists utilizing modem technology identify complex and unknown problems and develop solutions for them.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

        By developing this project, I took the technical mindset needed as a computer scientist to build and solve the solution for the game. Not only was a solution needed for this project, but it also needed to be efficient in solving the problem. Therefore, I needed to expand my horizons and utilize various resources to learn and adapt my solution. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

        As an end user and a software developer, to be constantly thinking and aware of the ethical concerns and issues a product may develop. It’s critical to understand how your software can be used and set it in a way the end user and customer will use it correctly.
